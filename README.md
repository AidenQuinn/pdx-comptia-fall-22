### About

This is a sample repo demonstrating how our cohort could use GitHub to stay in touch outside of class. Check out [these docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/communicating-on-github) on GitHub if you're looking for a high level overview. Features:

1. Create [`issues`](https://github.com/AidenQuinn/pdx-comptia-fall-22/issues) on specific topics to get a conversation going
2. Comment on existing issues to contribute to that conversation
3. Email notifications can be configured so updates are sent to your inbox
4. Creation of `group` tags is supported
5. Repo could be public (like it is now) or private (so only members can see it)

#### Requires

- Personal GitHub account - [Sign Up](https://github.com/signup)
